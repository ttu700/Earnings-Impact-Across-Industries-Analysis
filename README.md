### [Earnings Impact Across Industries Analysis](https://github.com/ttu700/Earnings-Impact-Across-Industries-Analysis/tree/main/Earnings%20report/Earnings%20Research%20Project.pdf)

## Project Description
Earning announcements can have a significant impact on the price of stocks and we aim to understand the relationship between earnings announcements and the stock's price. A thorough understanding of how earnings announcement releases impact the price of a stock can help us to make informed investment decisions and minimize investment risk. 

## Test Design
To test our research question, whether earnings announcements can have a significant impact on the price of stocks, we decided to collect data from five different industries: Energy, Real 

## How data was collected
The information about common stock prices was gathered from Yahoo Finance and the earnings announcement-related information was collected from Alphavantage. We have chosen five industries to observe the relationship between stock prices and earning announcements since various industries often perform differently on the stock market. The industries are energy, real estate, technology, retail, and pharmaceuticals. 

## Hypothesis
H0 = Earnings surprise  - Price Difference Before & After Announcement = 0 

(Earning Announcement has no effect on stock price)

Ha = Earnings surprise - Price Difference Before & After Announcement â‰  0 

(Earning Announcement has an effect on stock price)
